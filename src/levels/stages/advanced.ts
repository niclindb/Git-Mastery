You've just finished implementing a complex feature over the past week. Looking back at your commit history, you cringe:

- "WIP: trying to fix login"
- "oops, forgot semicolon"
- "debugging session, lots of console.logs"
- "FINALLY WORKS!!!"
- "removed console.logs"
- "fixed typo in comment"

Your team lead, Sarah, pulls you aside:

"Hey, I see you've been busy with the authentication feature. Before we merge this to main, let's clean up that commit history. Future developers (including yourself in 6 months) will thank you."

"Think of Git commits as chapters in a book. Right now, your story reads like a stream of consciousness. Let's edit it into a clear, logical narrative."

The power of interactive rebase:
- Combine related commits (squash) with \`git rebase -i HEAD~3\`
- Reorder commits for logical flow
- Rewrite commit messages for clarity
- Remove commits that add no value

Remember: This is powerful magic. Only rewrite history on branches that haven't been shared with others!`,

You're the detective on duty, and the pressure is mounting. The CEO is asking questions, the customer support team is overwhelmed, and somewhere in the 47 commits pushed since Friday, there's a bug hiding.

Your senior developer Alex walks over with a concerned look:

"We need to find this bug fast. The payment system was definitely working on Friday before the weekend deployments. Now it's broken. That's probably... what, 50 commits to check?"

"Normally, you'd have to check each commit manually - that could take hours. But Git has a secret weapon: bisect. It's like a binary search for bugs."

Here's how Git bisect works:
1. You tell Git a 'good' commit (payment worked)
2. You tell Git a 'bad' commit (payment broken)
3. Git checks out the middle commit
4. You test and mark it good or bad
5. Git repeats until it finds the exact culprit

Instead of checking 50 commits, you'll only need to check about 6. That's the power of binary search!

Time to become a Git detective. Let's hunt down this bug!`,

- hotfix/urgent-bug-fix (merged last week)
- experiment/new-ui (abandoned)
- feature/payment-gateway (merged)
- bugfix/typo-in-header (merged)
- draft/crazy-idea (never finished)

Your new team member, Jordan, is completely overwhelmed:

"How do I know which branches are safe to work with? There are 47 branches here, and I have no idea what's current!"

Your team lead nods knowingly: "Time for a repository cleanup. In a healthy Git workflow, we should regularly prune old branches. Think of it like cleaning your desk - it helps everyone focus on what matters."

The cleanup process:
1. Identify branches that have been merged
2. Safely delete merged branches
3. Remove remote tracking branches for deleted branches
4. Archive or delete abandoned experiments
5. Document the current active branches
